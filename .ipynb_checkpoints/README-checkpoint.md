# Trading Algorithm Performance Report 

## Baseline Trading Algorithm 

The Baseline Trading ALgorithm strategy returns are very similar to the actual returns. The model has a high percission; however, the recall is not high. The strategy returns resemble the actual returns; however, in some cases they ar opposite of the actual returns as observed in the ggraph below.

## Tuning Baseline Trading Algorithm

### Step 1

To do so, slice your data into different periods. Rerun the notebook with the updated parameters, and record the results in your README.md file.
Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?
